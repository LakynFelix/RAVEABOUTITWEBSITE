                        <p>The coronavirus pandemic is continuing to develop as we speak. With every day that passes, there are still far too many people blatantly ignoring the government's clear instructions. <span>People are losing their jobs, friends and family members are becoming ill, and that's just scratching the surface. </span>Individuals who haven't been touched by the COVID-19 might not realize the severity of the virus. The reality of these unprecedented times is that death could be closer than we think. </p>
                        <p>Although the passing of a loved one may not be the end result, we want you to give some thought to the big picture. By stepping outside, you are not only putting yourself at risk, but others as well. Furthermore, the longer this pandemic continues, the longer people will be out of a job, and others will continue to be layed off. The fact that shows and festivals have begun to be postponed and cancelled is only the beginning. Many more of the things you're looking forward to may be next... </p>
                        <p>Recently, <strong>Ghastly</strong> took to Twitter to confirm how the coronavirus has directly impacted him and his family. He shared, "[...] <em>we've lost one and another tested positive. If I see anyone in large groups I now have the right to shoot you with paintballs</em>" The American producer clearly tried to make light of the situation, but the fact that a death has happened and another one could potentially occur is extremely troublesome. </p>

                        <p><span>We encourage you to take a moment to think about people like <strong>David Lee Crow</strong>, better known by his stage name Ghastly, the next time you consider gathering in large groups. It's a devastating reality that we're not able to be close to the people we care about. We all have to do our part in order to have a bright future! There are several ways you can help, like washing your hands regularly for 20 seconds (with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub), or avoiding close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell.</span></p>
                        <p><span>The topic of wearing masks is one that has continued to strike up an important debate. </span><span>Ghastly recently spoke on this subject by stating, </span><span>"[...]<em> it shows me and everyone around you that you are taking this seriously care not only for your health but for humanity as a whole</em>". </span><span>Fans were quick to share their views. Keep in mind, there are plenty of relevant resources to assist in educating us. We'd love to hear your thoughts on the subject. Let us know via our official social media channels!</span></p>

                        <p>On behalf of <strong>The Flag Gang</strong>, we'd like to extend our deepest condolences to Ghastly and his family during this difficult time. In addition, we will also be keeping everyone else who's been directly affected by the coronavirus in our thoughts. We're in this together, Flag fam! Make sure to check in on each other, and remember, even the smallest gesture goes a long way!</p>
