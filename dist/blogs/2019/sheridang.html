                        <p style="text-align: left;">Ottawa's local Trance legend,<strong> Sheridan Grout, </strong>has been rising to success with chart-topping singles such as<strong> '<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4u7fpGSueO9Kc6qruXQmJJ">Broken To Pieces</a>' </strong>and<strong> '<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0z90gMq6DR3rgm2xZMEApm">Bad Days</a>'.</strong></p>
                        <p style="text-align: left;">Whether he's working as a full-time Accountant or traveling the globe as a DJ, there is nothing stopping this 28-year-old from continuing to surpass everyone's expectations!  </p>
                        <p style="text-align: left;">Recently, we sat down with the Canadian producer to discuss his distinct sound, creation process, ongoing accomplishments, future releases, among much more. Check it out below...</p>
                        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>1. You've been continuously putting out track after track. Is there a specific song that you feel connected to more so than others? Why does it stand out among the rest?</strong></p>
                        <p><em>I would have to say '<strong>The Last Word</strong>' because when I heard the vocal for the first time, I had shivers! It brought me back to personal experiences, and I felt that it would do that for other people as well. </em></p>
                        <p><em>The concept behind the track, and especially the lyric/hook, "let's make love the last word", truly brings people together. It can also be applied to many moments in one's life, which ultimately makes it relatable to all.    </em></p>
                        <p><em><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c_v4A2b-u8s" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></em></p>
                        <p><strong>2. How has the success of 'Love Runs Out' affected your musical journey thus far?</strong></p>
                        <p><em>That particular track has been a huge accomplishment of mine. It's been out for a little over a month, and it has 8,000 streams and counting - which is amazing! </em></p>
                        <p><em>It's awesome to see the fans' reception - especially thanks to <strong>Spotify</strong>'s handy statistic system that they have in place. </em></p>
                        <p><em>From a musical point of view, it reconfirms that my sound is one that people do, truly, love. For an artist, that's extremely important. Sometimes, you have a few releases and they don't do all that well, which makes you question if you have to change your sound. </em></p>
                        <p><em>When I released '<a href="https://garuda183.lnk.to/LRO"><strong>Love Runs Out</strong></a>', and the results reflected the fans' love, it took me back to why I started this in the first place, ultimately, reconfirming why people keep coming back to listen to my music - for that distinct sound. </em></p>
                        <p><strong>3. How would you describe your sound?</strong></p>
                        <p><em>It's very lyrical with stabbing chords; the main focus is always around emotional melodies, normally paired with lyrics that spark some kind of emotion to anyone who is listening. My goal is to tear at your heartstrings. </em></p>
                        <p><strong>4. What is the creative process like when seeking out lyrics for your pieces?</strong></p>
                        <p><em>Initially, it starts with me listening to a ton of vocalist's vocals in all genres, not just Trance. It helps me figure out who's voice and writing I prefer. Conclusively, finding the right person that fits the track.  </em></p>
                        <p><em>Throughout my career, I've worked with female artists who have worked in Trance, however, I've worked closely with others who have not worked in the genre. I look towards the Pop genre for a fresh take.</em></p>
                        <p><em>Once I've found a vocalist that I like, I normally reach out to them to discuss their interest in the track and I'll lay down a rough idea of what I have in mind (i.e. the melody).</em></p>
                        <p><em>Following that, the vocalist will write on top of the ideas that I had sent over, and then we'll go back and forth until we're both happy with the result.</em></p>
                        <p><strong>5. We've heard through the grapevine that you have a new release coming out on July 5, 2019. What we can expect from the single?</strong></p>
                        <p><em>In my opinion, '<strong>Free Fall</strong>' on <strong>Garuda Music</strong> could potentially be the biggest track that I've released to date. </em></p>
                        <p><em>I worked alongside <a href="https://www.facebook.com/blueyesmusic/"><strong>BLÜ EYES</strong></a> - she's an impeccably talented vocalist. I had first heard her track with <strong>Somna</strong> called '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECM_cKGM5oI"><strong>Believer</strong></a>', which was released on <strong>Armada Music</strong>. I absolutely loved her voice! I had that song on repeat and kept saying to myself "I need to work with her, I need to work with her..." </em></p>
                        <p><em>We finally got together and worked on 'Free Fall'. It was very natural in terms of flow when creating a single together.</em></p>
                        <p><em>Once it was complete, I had sent it into Garuda and they immediately snatched it up. It was an exciting feeling of accomplishment. </em></p>
                        <p><strong>6. What's next on the horizon?</strong></p>
                        <p><em>I have lots of new releases which will be coming out on Garuda, <strong>Armada Music</strong>, <strong>A State of Trance</strong>, and via <strong>Ava Recordings</strong>.</em></p>
                        <p><em>I don't have much in the works for touring, at the moment, because I'm trying to focus on the music. In the next 6-8 months, I would say, it will be my biggest release of tracks. </em></p>
                        <p><em>You can expect that this incoming wave of singles will very much reflect my sound, and I personally think it's some of my best work.</em></p>
                        <p><strong></strong><strong>7. How did it feel when you first found out that 'Awaken' would be signed to Armin van Buuren's A State of Trance compilation?</strong></p>
                        <p><em>I remember getting that email - I jumped right out of bed, and yelled, "yes!" I was so excited!</em></p>
                        <p><em>It's such a big compilation to be on. It's an honour anytime Armin supports your track, however, it blew my mind that he loved it so much that he featured it on such a huge platform. </em></p>
                        <p><em>It was a complete adrenaline rush and reminded me why I started this journey. It was a moment I'll never forget. </em></p>
                        <p><em><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YAQ3slnvYJ0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></em></p>
                        <p><strong>8. Is there anything else you'd like to share with The Flag Gang?</strong></p>
                        <p><em>Thank you for supporting me. You guys are awesome! I'm so looking forward to meeting more of The Flag Gang in person; hopefully at some of my upcoming shows [keep it locked to my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SheridanGroutOfficial/">official social media</a> channels for more event related information]. I'll see you guys soon!  </em></p>
